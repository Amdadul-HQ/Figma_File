Front-end development is my jam! I've been pouring 10-12 hours a day into learning for the past 6 months. My passion for coding burns bright, even pulling all-nighters to crack problems. I see a full-time career in this, and with my dedication and growing skillset, I'm confident I can build amazing applications solo!

In the past few months, I completed a comprehensive Front-End Development course. What excites me most is that I can now build entire websites independently! One specific challenge I faced was during Assignment #11, where the deadline was just 3 days. Unfortunately, a major tornado hit our city on the first day.  Determined to complete the assignment on time, I packed my desktop PC and traveled to another city!  It was a big effort, but I'm proud to say I delivered the assignment successfully. This experience showed my dedication and ability to overcome obstacles.
